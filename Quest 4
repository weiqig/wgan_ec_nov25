#Part 1
#For the following solutions we assume that since we only care about the output for the first and last gear,
#we will only use the first and last gear to calculate the number of rotations made by the aforementioned gears.

my_list = [1000, 149]
rotations = 2025

result = (my_list[0] / my_list[-1]) * rotations

#Part 2
rotations = 10000000000000

# plus 1 to the final output to account for a full turn for minimum amount of turns
result = 1 + (1 / (my_list[0] / my_list[-1])) * rotations
